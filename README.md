# PHPscriptsForWork

Random scripts I use at work. Most of the code I write are proprietary and confidential.

These are some which are't but still quite useful.

- String concatenator to prep numbers and texts for database queries, web forms
- WordPress URL Shortcut Tool which grabs direct URLs to edit blog posts
- Bulk domain extractor to extract domains from a list of URLs
- Proxy matcher to grab full proxy from list based on partially masked subnets/IPs
