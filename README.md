# PHPscriptsForWork

Random scripts I use at work. Most of the code I write are proprietary and confidential. Here's a few which aren't but are quite useful day in & out. Some of these use our proprietary framework to prevent devs from re-inventing the wheel.

# General 
- String concatenator to prep numbers and texts for database queries, web forms
- Bulk domain extractor to extract domains from a list of URLs
- Bulk site status checker (if you don't have ScreamingFrog or don't wanna pay for UptimeRobot)
- Bulk scrape finder (if you don't have ScreamingFrog or need to check a specific text on a site - not regex)
- Bulk email verifier using Zerobounce's API

# WordPress
- URL Shortcut Creator which grabs direct URLs to edit WordPress pages & blog posts 
- "Unslugify" Tool which converts "pretty permalinks" to their equivalent URLs with id parameters 

# Niche
- Proxy matcher to grab full proxy from list based on partially masked subnets/IPs
- Mouse plotter that tracks mouse movement (for bot research)
